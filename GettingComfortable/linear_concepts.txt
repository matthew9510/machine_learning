LINEAR ALGEBRA DEFINITION
Linear algebra is the study of vectors (a finite sequence of numbers) and linear functions that act on those vectors.
It's usage can be found in pretty much every endeavor involving mathematics in some way,
from computation and statistics to the natural sciences (note that plugging in numbers to equations is not math).

Matricies are everywhere.
One reason why matrices are so important is because we can pack so much information into them

WHAT THE DOT PRODUCT REPRESENTS
The dot product tells you what amount of one vector goes in the direction of another.
For instance, if you pulled a box 10 meters at an inclined angle, there is a horizontal component and a vertical component to your force vector.
So the dot product in this case would give you the amount of force going in the direction of the displacement, or in the direction that the box moved.
This is important because work is defined to be force multiplied by displacement, but the force here is defined to be the force in the direction of the displacement.

Recall that between two vectors u and v, u^(T)*v is equal to the dot product between u and v.
    u⋅v=∥u∥∥v∥cosθ
where θ is of course the angle between u and v and ∥u∥ is the length of u, and vice versa. The squared length of a vector (e.g. u) is therefore given by u⋅u.

Thus we see immediately that the transposition of vectors are critical for providing the properties of sizes and angles.
In fact, the reason why linear algebra is so useful is that vectors are the simplest mathematical objects for which notions of sizes and angles, and thus similarity, can be provided.

MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
[[1]  x [1,2,3]
 [2]
 [3]]
We are not always going to have the same number of rows and columns, as long as matrix1 has the same number of columns as matrix2 has rows we can multiply
