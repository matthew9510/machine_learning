#### Abstract Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to practice programming skills that my team learned over the semester.

Using the [wine quality dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) we created multiple models to compare and contrast results.

Models used:
- [Logistic regression](logistic_regression.py)
- [K-nearest neighbors](knn.py)
- [Neural network](neural_network.py)
- [Random forest](random_forest.py)
- [Support Vector machine](svm.py)
