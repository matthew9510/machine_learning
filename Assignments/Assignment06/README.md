### Assignment06

[Assignment instructions](ha6.docx)

#### Abstract Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to practice the classification model Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Built a SVM classifier that can identify the gender of a crab from its physical measurements.  

For every crab, there are six physical features: species, front-allip, rear- width, length, width and depth.  

The first time I manually selected the parameters I found out that this procedure is not very effective and only detects the best c value for only one type of kernel. I wrote a script to determine the best c values for the following kernel types; ‘linear’, ‘poly’, ‘rbf’.
