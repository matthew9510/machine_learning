#### Abstract Overview

This assignment includes three problems for practicing logistic regression methods and evaluation metrics. 

The goal of this assignment is to predict the binary class label for any sample described with two features using the **logistic regression** method for solving a simulated problem. 

In addition using the confusion matrix we will analyze the following:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Misclassification rates
- True positive rates
- False positive rates
- True negative rates
